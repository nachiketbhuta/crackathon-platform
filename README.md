### Description 
-----------------------------------------

>The platform was created for the first round of crackathon 2019, an annual contest held by codecell. It lets a team login with an alredy generated username and password after which the user is given a jumbled code that he is supposed to rearrange to get the proper order of the code. The user is awarded with 100 points for a correct answer and penalized with 10 points for a wrong submission.
